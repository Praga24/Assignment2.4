1.Importance of Name node in Hadoop cluster :
HDFS has a master/slave architecture.
An HDFS cluster consists of a single NameNode, a master that manages the file system namespace and regulates access to files by clients.
NameNode is single point of failure in hadoop cluster.
NameNode is so critical to HDFS and when the NameNode is down, HDFS is inaccessible and considered down.
NameNode only stores the metadata of HDFS, the directory tree of all files in the file system, and tracks the files across the cluster.
